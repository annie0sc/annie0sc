Life Update!
It has been almost 5yrs since I came to the US, joined multiple companies, and worked for a few. My roles varied from Software Engineer to Developer but mostly revolved around Java, Spring Boot, and Bash Scripting. I did attempt to update my skills by starting certification courses in Udemy, Coursera, and Hacckerrank. 
Unfortunately (dramatic roll), I am inconsistent with my progress, and the certifications are incomplete. Typical.
Now, I dream of applying for a Ph.D. program AND getting a full scholarship. 
Sorry, the reason for all this ranting is that I want to challenge myself to aim high, complete my courses, update my skills through certifications, and achieve a Ph.D. in my favorite field, ML.
